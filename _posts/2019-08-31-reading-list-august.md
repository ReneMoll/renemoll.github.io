* [The “terrible” 3 cent MCU – a short survey of sub $0.10 microcontrollers](https://cpldcpu.wordpress.com/2019/08/12/the-terrible-3-cent-mcu/) - [reddit discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/embedded/comments/cq9cho/the_terrible_3_cent_mcu_a_short_survey_of_sub_010/)

  I was not aware of this practice, and find it interesting to see companies create such cheap MCUs by improving on existing designs. That said, I am happy not having to face the related challenges. Which include: limited debug support and single programming, anymore.

* [What I learned co-founding Dribbble](http://simplebits.com/2019/06/25/dribbble.html)

  Good write-up of tips and do's that make sense when read. I think it contains valuable pointers on how to create a community which not only uses your product but is invested and involved in getting the best out of it. I enjoyed the examples regarding the observation of the users using the website and continuously introducing small and complete changes (as opposed to ship fast and fix later). This philosophy resonates with me, to give your users a proper baseline experience and improve step by step. That is how I like to use a product.

* [We have ruined childhood](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/17/opinion/sunday/childhood-suicide-depression-anxiety.html)

  Yikes, I found this a freighting insight into the life of a child. Personally, I believe kids need to be able to play; inside, outside, with friends. I personally enjoyed a childhood filled with playing outside, going home for lunch with my mom and my sister and pursuing my own interests.

  Homework, and any serious testing, only started when I began secondary school. Fortunately, living in Europe means any kids I may get will not have to train for shooting incidents. Yet I do see similarities where kids play less outside, parents planning playdates and kids being brought to school and then off to day-care because mom and dad need to work the whole week. I cannot imagine this being the ideal family picture and I certainly hope I can spend a lot of time with my family by then. 

* [Things I Learnt The Hard Way](https://blog.juliobiason.net/thoughts/things-i-learnt-the-hard-way/)

  A nice collection of tips and advice regarding software development. I believe I have read these before throughout multiple blogs, articles and comments. It is always good to re-read such tips and be reminded of items you can improve on. Which is why I appreciate this collection.
