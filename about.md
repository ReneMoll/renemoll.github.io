Hi, my name is Ren√©, I am an System Architect at <a href="https://www.xsens.com/">Xsens</a> and I am passionate about embedded systems. I use this blog and the <a href="https://radar.thoughtworks.com/?sheetId=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fspreadsheets%2Fd%2F1gzXoC0yBHf9pDuI3BucHCznNVYJd8smUu9phCi-ckbc%2Fedit">Technology RADAR</a> to keep track of topics I find interesting. Mainly related to embedded systems, programming, C++, Python and (in time) a little bit of Rust.
